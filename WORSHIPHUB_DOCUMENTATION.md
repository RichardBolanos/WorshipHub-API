## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE EXCELLENCE**

### **✅ Clean Architecture Implementation**
- **Domain Layer:** Pure business logic, no framework dependencies
- **Application Layer:** Use cases and orchestration services
- **Infrastructure Layer:** JPA entities, repositories, external services
- **API Layer:** REST controllers, DTOs, security configuration

### **✅ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **4 Bounded Contexts:** Organization, Catalog, Scheduling, Collaboration
- **Aggregate Roots:** Church, User, Song, ServiceEvent properly modeled
- **Domain Services:** SetlistGenerationService, ChordTransposer
- **Domain Events:** SongCreated, ServiceScheduled with event handlers

### **✅ Enterprise Patterns**
- **Repository Pattern:** Domain interfaces with infrastructure implementations
- **CQRS Elements:** Separate read/write models where appropriate
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Domain events for cross-aggregate communication
- **Dependency Inversion:** All dependencies point inward to domain

---

## 🔐 **SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **⚠️ Authentication & Authorization - NEEDS OVERHAUL**
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management
- ✅ **4-tier role system:** SUPER_ADMIN, CHURCH_ADMIN, WORSHIP_LEADER, TEAM_MEMBER
- ✅ **Method-level security** with @PreAuthorize on all sensitive endpoints
- ✅ **Password policies** with complexity requirements
- ✅ **Email verification** - Complete with secure tokens and 24h expiration
- ✅ **Password recovery** - Complete with secure tokens and 1h expiration
- ✅ **User registration** - Complete church + admin registration flow
- ✅ **Invitation system** - Complete with 7-day tokens and acceptance workflow

### **✅ Production Security - PARTIAL**
- ✅ **Externalized secrets** via environment variables
- ✅ **Token blacklisting** for secure logout
- ✅ **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- ✅ **Rate limiting** (100 requests/minute per IP)
- ⚠️ **Audit logging** - Basic implementation, needs enhancement
